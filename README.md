This repository contains the design proposal for a SNAP-TRACE-zipper component.  

### The "Zipper" component was proposed by various CAMP members to facilitate creating connections within a TRACE vessel component.  There are typically mutliple such connections needed and having this new zipper component type will help users organize and quickly create such connections. ###

From CAMP meeting notes:

Added Fall 2016.  Dr. Staudenmeier stated that the NRC’s recommendation is to use the vessel component to model multiple pipes.

Update Fall 2017:  Dr. Bernard indicated that NRC apparently misunderstood the request, and he thinks there is some valid work to be done on this item.  This will be discussed internally at NRC.

Update Fall 2018:  Mr. Gingrich noted that nothing has been done yet.  He said it’s not deferred, they just simply haven’t gotten to it yet. Dr. Staudenmeier **recommended not hooking pipes in parallel; he recommended using the VESSEL component instead.  On exception might be as a first step in converting a RELAP5 model with cross flow junctions to TRACE.**

Update Fall 2019:  Dr. Matthew Bernard indicated that the **real need is to provide a convenient way to connect multiple components to the VESSEL component.**  Mr. Gingrich noted that this is already planned, they just have gotten to it yet.

Update Spring 2021: Reviewing design and confirming requirements.
