This repository contains the design proposal for a SNAP-TRACE-zipper component.  

The "Zipper" component was proposed by various CAMP members to facilitate creating connections within a TRACE vessel component.  There are typically mutliple such connections needed and having this new zipper component type will help users organiza and quickly create such connections.

Users of this repository can either choose to modify the design document directly, or simply create comments, or "issues" to enter your comments.
